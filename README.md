FirstPerson
===========

A useless game, just for the purpose of practicing and showing off my OpenGL and 3D skills.
You will need [OpenTK](http://opentk.com/) to run this. As of now, it probably will only work on Windows.

Perhaps in the future, I might even continue this project and make it a REAL game, as I do have a small idea for one. Who knows?
